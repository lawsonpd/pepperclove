1. After registering, user should be automatically authenticated and then sent to main page.

2. Create custom user.
   - need custom registration, login, profile management, authentication

3. Only show contact info *after* bid has been chosen.

4. When offer is rendered, pass in duration and display a countdown timer with javascript.

5. Show number of bids for each offer.

6. ** If a place's bid is accepted, the other bids should be voided. (Make this an option the user can set?)

7. A user should (probably) be warned before placing a duplicate bid for an order. (Would they ever want to submit two bids? Is that fair? Why or why not?)

RESOLVED 8. Do we even need to store the duration on the model? Can't we just ask for it at submission, use it to calculate the expiry (which we will store), and then discard it?

9. When user submits offer or bid, check that they haven't made the same offer/bid the same day.

10. Error handling (500, 404, etc.)

** 11. Feedback handling

** 12. Custom admin login template

13. SMS notifications

14. What's the best way to handle registration (so that only local restaurants can signup)?

** 15. Show two or three most recent orders on the home page.

16. SSL? https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/, https://medium.com/@franxyzxyz/setting-up-free-https-with-heroku-ssl-and-lets-encrypt-80cf6eac108e

17. Currently, the offer details template only shows bids that are not expired. It should probably show all the bids and annotate the statuses thereof.

** 18. There isn't a good reason to go to '/offers' after '/my-offers'. The '/my-offers' page should have the bids listed for each offer and the 'details' link should be replaced by direct links to each bid. (Same for my-bids.)

** 19. Make sure post requests can't be made for bid/offer submission that aren't allowed (* even if the template logic blocks such submissions).
