premium options:
- save items (offers) to use again

if there are two restaurants that didn't win a bid, then suggest they trade between themselves

* businesses need to have their profiles verified (make several at the beginning for restaurants we already trade with)

should 'my offers' and 'my bids' be routed at '/offers/<merchant>/' & '/bids/<merchant>/'?

somehow need to get the no. of bids for an offer to show on the main offers page.

should restaurants be able to set a radius for who can bid on their orders?
