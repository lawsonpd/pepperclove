premium options:
- save items (offers) to use again

if there are two restaurants that didn't win a bid, then suggest they trade between themselves

* businesses need to have their profiles verified (make several at the beginning for restaurants we already trade with)

should 'my offers' and 'my bids' be routed at '/offers/<merchant>/' & '/bids/<merchant>/'?

somehow need to get the no. of bids for an offer to show on the main offers page.

  def index(request):
      latest_question_list = Question.objects.order_by('-pub_date')[:5]
      template = loader.get_template('polls/index.html')
      context = {
          'latest_question_list': latest_question_list,
      }
      return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))
