1. After registering, user should be automatically authenticated and then sent to main page.

2. Create custom user.
   - need custom registration, login, profile management, authentication

3. Only show contact info *after* bid has been chosen.

4. When offer is rendered, pass in duration and display a countdown timer with javascript.

5. Show number of bids for each offer.

6. ** If a place's bid is accepted, the other bids should be voided. (Make this an option the user can set?)

7. A user should (probably) be warned before placing a duplicate bid for an order. (Would they ever want to submit two bids? Is that fair? Why or why not?)

RESOLVED 8. Do we even need to store the duration on the model? Can't we just ask for it at submission, use it to calculate the expiry (which we will store), and then discard it?

9. When user submits offer or bid, check that they haven't made the same offer/bid the same day.
